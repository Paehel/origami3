    <h1> FLAPPING BIRD</h1>
    <h2> Follow these instructions to make an origami Flapping bird</h2>


    <img src = "1.jpg"> </img>
    <p>  Start with a square piece of origami paper</p>

    <img src = "2.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the paper in half by taking the top corner and folding it over to the bottom corner</p>

    <img src = "3.jpg"> </img>
    <p>  Once again, fold the paper in half by taking the left corner and folding it to the right</p>

    <img src = "4.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Take the top flap and open it, creasing the left and right sides so you can fold the the top corner to the bottom corner</p>
    
    <img src = "5.jpg"> </img>
    <p>Flip the paper and do the same thing on the other side</p>

    <img src = "6.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Open up the flap and crease the left and right sides so the top corner can meet the bottom corner</p>

    <img src = "7.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the left and right corners from the bottom to meet at the middle</p>

    <img src = "8.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the top triangle down</p>

    <img src = "9.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Unfold the triangle back up along with the left and right flaps</p>

    <img src = "10.jpg"> </img>
    <p>Take the bottom of the top layer and open it. Using the creases as guides, fold the left and right sides in to the center</p>

    <img src = "11.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Turn the figure over and do the same on the other side</p>

    <img src = "12.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the left and right corners in from the bottom to the center</p>

    <img src = "13.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Unfold</p>

    <img src = "14.jpg"> </img>
    <p>  Open the top layer beginning at the bottom and lift it all the way up. Using the creases as guides, fold the left and right sides in to the center</p>

    <img src = "15.jpg"> </img>
    <p>Take the top layer from the right side and fold it over to the left</p>

    <img src = "16.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Turn the figure over so and repeat the step on the other side</p>

    <img src = "17.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the right flap over to the left</p>

    <img src = "18.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up</p>

    <img src = "19.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Turn the figure over to the other side</p>

    <img src = "20.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Fold the bottom flap up</p>

    <img src = "21.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Take the two wedges inside and pull them out like you see in the picture</p>

    <img src = "22.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Take the left wedge and open it slightly and bend a portion down to form the head. Do an inside reverse fold by pushing the center of the head down and creasing the left and right sides together</p>
    
    <img src = "23.jpg"> </img>
    <p> Here's the tricky part. Hold the chest of the bird including a little bit of the wing, and fold the rest of the wing down. You don't need a sharp fold here, just keep molding the wing until it stays down</p>
   
    <img src = "24.jpg"> </img>
    <p>  Pull the tail and the bird will come alive!</p>
